           <h2> About Placement</h2>
        <p>
            Placement is that time of the year when students move out of the wonderful cocoon that the college has created to develop and nurture them, into full-grown butterflies - ready to take on the world with their skills.

            C-DAC placements create a platform where students can showcase their talents which different companies seek to explore and utilize. Starting from 1993, we have successfully placed a large section of graduates who have appeared for placements. This year especially, the performance has been overwhelming.

            The moment you step foot at C-DAC, the process of shaping and moulding you for the real world begins. From day one itself, the focus is to get one ready to bag the best possible offer from industry bigwigs, at the end of six months when the Post Graduate Diploma programmes culminate.

            C-DAC helps students in exploring placement opportunities by inviting companies for Common Campus Placement Programme. The final placements at C-DAC are a culmination of systematic and continued interaction with industry and ongoing and enduring career counselling as well as grooming of the students by mentors and Career Development Centre.

            The interview process usually starts with company introduction enlightens the students with company profile followed by written test, group discussion, and personal interview. The underlying idea is to acquaint the students with the companies, their culture, and the domain, how they differentiated from their competitors, the job roles, growth rate, the expectations from students, the selection process, required skill sets and other aspects needed to build a lasting career.
